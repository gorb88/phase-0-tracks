Elevator Algorithm

-Determine and remember desired floor.
-Locate indicator of current floor on wall and remember that value.
-If current floor matches desired floor, 
    -Direction is equal to nil and end program.
-If current floor is less than desired floor, 
    -Direction is equal to up.
-If current floor is greater than desired floor, 
    -Direction is equal to down.
-If direction is not nil
    -Locate up/down buttons on wall by elevator.
    -With the appropriate force, press button matching desired direction.
    -Wait for elevator direction light and ding to indicate an elevator with matching direction has arrived.
    -Enter elevator and check each wall for control panel.
    -Once located, find button marked with number equal to the desired floor destination
    -With the appropriate force, press and hold previous button for 0.5 seconds and release.
    -Wait until ding and elevator floor indicator matches desired floor
        -Wait for doors to open.
        -Exit

Tuning Algorithm for Electric Guitars.

- Choose number of strings (ie: 4, 6, 7, 12)
- Choose guitar tuning. (ie: EADGBE, DGBA)
- Remember tuning machine arrangement (ie: 6 inline, 3x3)
- Plug a cable into guitar with one end and a tuning pedal with another.
- If power supply is available
    - Plug power supply into tuning pedal
- If power supply is unavailable,
    - Make sure pedal has battery.
- Depress and release footswitch momentarily to turn on.
- Initialize a boolean to remember whether each iteration through the strings has had all strings in tune.
- Starting on lowest string iterating through each until highest based on number of strings.
    - If string is first string, set boolean to true.
    - Store working string orientation value
    - Store working tuning machine position value
    - Pluck string.
    - Read Tuning pedal
    - If pedal reads in tune, move to next string.
    - If pedal reads flat
        - Set boolean as false
        -Twist tuning machine attached to working string in direction that applys tension to string, depending on string orientation and tuning machine position.
        - Rotate tuning machine until tuning pedal reads in tune.
    - If pedal reads sharp
        - Set boolean as false
        -Twist tuning machine attached to working string in direction that reduces tension on string, depending on string orientation and tuning machine position.
        - Rotate tuning machine until tuning pedal reads in tune.
- Repeat until all strings read in tune on tuning pedal. (Boolean is true after 6th string)
