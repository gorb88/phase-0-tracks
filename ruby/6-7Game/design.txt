One user can enter a word (or phrase, if you would like your game to support that), and another user attempts to guess the word.


Guesses are limited, and the number of guesses available is related to the length of the word.


Repeated guesses do not count against the user.


The guessing player receives continual feedback on the current state of the word. So if the secret word is "unicorn", the user will start out seeing something like "_ _ _ _ _ _ _", which would become "_ _ _ c _ _ _" after the user enters a guess of "c".

The user should get a congratulatory message if they win, and a taunting message if they lose.

Game class:

attributes:
goal_word - accessor
current_word - accessor
guesses_left - accessor
letters_guessed - accessor

methods:

initialize
    input: word
    set guesses_left based on length of word.
    set goal_word
    output: none

guess
    input: letter
        if not already guessed
         increment guess_number
         add guess to letters_guessed
    output: letter

is_game_over
    input: none
        check to see if guesses is over maximum
        or if word is guessed
    output: boolean

update_current_word
    input: none
        iterate through goal word, checking against letters guessed,
            replace each unguessed letter with "_"
    output: array

print_status
    input: none
        print word and guesses
    output: none

results
    input: none
        Print winner
        based on word is guessed
        or guesses over max
    output: none


Driver code:

declare game_over boolean, set to false

Ask for word.
Create new game based on word received

while game_over is false
    print status
    ask for letter
    update
    if game is over, change game_over to true

print results
