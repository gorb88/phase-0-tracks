What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

Semantic tags are used to clearly describe meaning of elements to the browser and the developer, instead of using meaningless div elements for everything.
Obviously main is going to be used all the time. Footer, header and nav tags will probably be used in the vast majority of applications. Article, aside, and to a less extent section are probably a little more specialized.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

Is this a trick question? The default order is as it's written in the html, top to bottom, in the order the opening tags appear. This can be changed arbitrarily using CSS positioning, however.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

Sublime is really flexible and customizable. Between making hotkeys and snippets I can see a lot of potential growth for personalized functionality.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

I think just deciding what kind of content should go in what kind of semantic tag was hardest to decide. I'll do some more search into good examples of what kind of content should live in which tags.
